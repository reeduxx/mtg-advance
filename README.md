# Magic the Gathering: Advance
Magic the Gathering game developed for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) system.

# What is this project?
The goal of this project is to bring Magic the Gathering to our beloved retro console. The final product will (hopefully) include all cards available before 8th Edition (6244 cards). This is to enable players to enjoy formats such as Old School 93-94 and Premodern. Inspirations for this game are drawn from the Yu-Gi-Oh World Tournament series of games for the GBA.
